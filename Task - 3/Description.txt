**Task 3 – Fetch Data from an API Using JavaScript**
**Project Title**
API Data Fetching Web Application

**Description**
This project is a web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that fetches real-time data from a public API and displays it dynamically on the webpage. This project demonstrates how to work with external APIs and handle asynchronous data using JavaScript.

**Objective**
To learn and apply API integration concepts in JavaScript by fetching and displaying real-time data from a public API.

**Technologies Used**
HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript
Fetch API (for API integration)

**Features**
Fetch real-time data from a public API
Display API data dynamically on the webpage
Handle asynchronous operations using JavaScript
User-friendly interface
Responsive design

**Project Structure**

**How It Works**
The application sends a request to a public API using the Fetch API.
JavaScript receives the response and converts it into JSON format.
The fetched data is processed and displayed dynamically on the webpage.
The UI updates automatically when new data is fetched.

**Concepts Covered**
Fetch API
Working with JSON data
Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises)
API integration
DOM manipulation

**Output**
A dynamic web application that displays real-time data fetched from an external API.
